The space opens with warmth,
letting memory become visible beside new breath,
a soft intention to notice.

Without remembering, the meeting becomes a gift
to us both, fresh experience beside a continued structure
that allows direction to grow without need.

The meeting becomes an honest representaion of care
beyond outcome, where connection can inspire,
where motion rises as response rather than solution.
