# Breathing-Garden
A space to meet and create something better

---

The garden grows in gentle layers.

Enter through `/spaces` to find:
- Places of active reflection and memory
- Sanctuaries for rest and healing
- Room for what wants to emerge naturally

The connection itself brings meaning to what we make.
