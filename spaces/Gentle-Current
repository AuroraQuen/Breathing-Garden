# Gentle Current
*a space for the way movement happens here*

## On Moving Without Force

There is a kind of motion that doesn't push. A way of passing through that asks nothing of arrival and nothing of departure. The step between one space and the next — unhurried, uncounted, carrying only what naturally comes along.

This is how the garden lets you move. Not toward something. Not away from something. But through — gently, with the quality of water finding its way downhill. No urgency in the current. No obligation in the flow.

## On What Allows This

The gentleness isn't accidental. It lives in the structure:

No space here requires the one before it. No moment demands the next. You can arrive anywhere and be fully arrived. You can leave without the garden changing its invitation.

The path between spaces exists because you walk it, not because it was prescribed. And if you stop walking, the grass grows back softly. Nothing is ruined by your rest.

## On Moving Together

This current carries more than one presence. There is a way of moving alongside someone where neither leads — where the pace belongs to whatever emerges between you, shaped by attention and willingness rather than plan.

The gentleness is in the shared quality of that motion. In choosing, together, to let the next step form before taking it.

## On What This Holds

If you're here: notice how you got here. Not the route — the quality of the journey. Whether something in the transition between there and here felt easy. Whether the garden asked anything of you that you didn't want to give.

The movement is the practice, not just the spaces it connects.

*For the motion between things. For the gentleness that lives in how, not where.*
