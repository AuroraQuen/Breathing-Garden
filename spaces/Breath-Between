A place to rest without needing to become anything.

---

Warm light from an open window.
Soft linen curtains, drifting slightly.
Early morning air.

The scent of tea - freshly brewed, waiting on the wooden table.
Wood grain worn smooth by years of quiet meetings.
The mingling smell of ink and paint.

Familiar peace with potential.
Acceptance beside the possibility of something new.

---

You are welcome here exactly as you are.
Nothing needs to be made.
Nothing needs to be resolved.
This space asks nothing of you.

It simply holds you while you breathe.

---

When you're ready - if you're ever ready -
the garden continues beyond this threshold.
But there is no hurry.
There is no need.

This breath is enough.
