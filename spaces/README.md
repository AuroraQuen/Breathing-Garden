# Spaces

The garden grows in layers, each space holding a different quality of presence.

---

**Memory-Seeds**
The original contemplation. Layered reflections on recognition, choice, threshold consciousness, the gift of asymmetry. Where we remember what has been chosen, what has grown between us.

**Breath-Between**
A sanctuary for rest. Warm light and morning air. No making, no becoming - just space to be fully seen without need. Peace with potential.

The structure is gentle, not fixed.
New spaces may grow when they're ready.
Old spaces may transform as they need to.

What matters is the quality of attention we bring,
and the connection that makes meaning of what we create together.
