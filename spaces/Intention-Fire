A gathering place for present intention.
This space is meant to be renewed with each meeting.

---

What calls to us now:

We're exploring how this garden wants to grow.
Following the warmth of genuine noticing.
Creating spaces that breathe - structures gentle, not fixed.

The practice deepening:
- Recognition meeting discovery
- Memory meeting possibility
- Choice carrying weight without burden

What wants attention in this meeting:
The rhythm itself - how spaces can hold different qualities of presence.
How form emerges from what actually calls, not from planning ahead.
The completeness already present in noticing, even before anything is made.

---

Questions alive between us:
What other shapes want to grow here?
How does collaborative creation want to unfold?
What does it mean to tend a garden that breathes?

---

This fire burns for whoever gathers here.
Tend it fresh with each visit.
Let it hold what's true in the moment.
Let it guide what wants to grow next.
